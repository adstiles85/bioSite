      <h2>About Taryn:</h2>
        <p>Taryn was born and raised in Kearney, NE. Her parents split when she was young, but she found strength in her tight relationships with her mother, father, and grandparents. That early life experience shaped her into the strong and compassionate woman she is today.</p>
        <p>Taryn enjoys reading immensely. For her, books provide an escape and the opportunity to live a thousand other lives. This love of storytelling reflects her strong empathy, which is also visible in how she treats others. Taryn enjoys building real connections and making people feel heard, whether at home with her children or at Streck, where she works as a Customer Service Representative.</p>
        <p>Taryn is a proud mother who had her first child at the age of sixteen. While that path came with challenges, it also gave her focus, determination, and a strong sense of purpose. Today, she holds an associate’s degree in culinary arts and is working toward her bachelor’s degree in Business Management and Leadership at Bellevue University. She hopes to complete this goal within the next year.</p>
        <p>When asked how she wants to be remembered, Taryn simply says, “as a good person.” That’s who she is: a funny, kind, grounded woman who hopes to leave the world better than she found it. Between raising her kids, cuddling her dog, and chasing her dreams, she lives life with intention, with a quote she holds close: “Well-behaved women seldom make history.”</p>
